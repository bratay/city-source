# City Source

New construction and architectural projects are undertaken every day, yet there is no efficient or easy way for the populace to obtain information about them.  Both future and in-development projects are often mysteries to the public. This not only elicits concern from citizens but also raises difficulties for architects and developers on the project.  Being unable to confer with community members prevents developers from receiving feedback about the projects and fully understanding the needs of the community.
  
Here arises the need for an application that facilitates communication between architects and the general population.  Our plan is to create a tool that can be used by architects to present their ideas for future projects to the members of the community.  Architects post projects on a map UI where community members may post and have conversations addressing these projects.  Community members can also post suggestions about developmental enhancements for the area, such as parks or restaurants.  With this tool, companies and cities will be able to better understand public opinion regarding the projects they work on, and citizens will have more influence over community development.
