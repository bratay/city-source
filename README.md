# City Source

New construction and architectural projects are undertaken every day,
yet there is no efficient or easy way for the populace to obtain 
information about them.  Both future and in-development projects are 
often mysteries to the public. This not only elicits concern from 
citizens but also raises difficulties for architects and developers on 
the project.  Being unable to confer with community members prevents 
developers from receiving feedback about the projects and fully 
understanding the needs of the community.
  

Here arises the need for an application that facilitates communication 
between architects and the general population.  Our plan is to create a 
tool that can be used by architects to present their ideas for future 
projects to the members of the community.  Architects post projects on a 
map UI where community members may post and have conversations 
addressing these projects.  Community members can also post suggestions 
about developmental enhancements for the area, such as parks or 
restaurants.  With this tool, companies and cities will be able to 
better understand public opinion regarding the projects they work on, 
and citizens will have more influence over community development.
